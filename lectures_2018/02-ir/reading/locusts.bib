% Shushin _starts_ with non-Markovian fluctuations driving a relaxation process, and then _postulates_ that those fluctuations are in turn driven by a Markov process.  I.e., there is no systematic construction of Markovian representations, just a hope that one exists, and a demonstration that Shushin is clever enough to find it for some particular cases.  (I probably couldn't.)
