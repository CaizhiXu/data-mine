        <p>In 1961, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara played golf at Havana's most exclusive country club. Too decadent, they thought. Instead, they decided, the land should be used for an arts institution to develop a ''new culture'' for the ''new man,'' said John A. Loomis, an author and architect. So, Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti and Roberto Gottardi, architects, designed five schools -- for plastic arts (top far right, as photographed in 1965), modern dance (bottom far right, 1965), music, theater and ballet. These brick and tile buildings, with Catalan vaults (right, 1992), fused Afro-Cuban culture with Hispanic-American and modernist ideas. Mr. Porro's School of Plastic Arts was inspired by the fertility goddesses of Afro-Cuban animist beliefs. It was, he said ecstatically last week, ''a city of breasts.'' But in 1965, construction was suspended, and the schools were opened unfinished. Castro had aligned himself with the Soviet model of standardized buildings. Mr. Porro left for Paris, and the schools fell into disrepair.</p>

        <p>In 1961, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara played golf at Havana's most exclusive country club. Too decadent, they thought. Instead, they decided, the land should be used for an arts institution to develop a ''new culture'' for the ''new man,'' said John A. Loomis, an author and architect. So, Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti and Roberto Gottardi, architects, designed five schools -- for plastic arts (top far right, as photographed in 1965), modern dance (bottom far right, 1965), music, theater and ballet.

Mr. Porro left for Paris, and the schools fell into disrepair.</p>
        <p>The creation and abandonment of the project -- and attempts to draw attention to the schools, still partly in use -- are documented in a book by Mr. Loomis, ''Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools: Revolution of Forms'' (Princeton Architectural Press, 1999). A photography show, ''Architecture and Revolution: Escuelas Nacionales de Arte en La Habana,'' runs through May 7 at the MAK Center for Art and Architecture in West Hollywood, (323) 651-1510, and the Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture, Columbia University, (212) 854-8165.</p>
