        <p>Minimalist classics -- has it come to that?</p>
        <p>Time was when Minimalist composers worked in obscurity in downtown Manhattan lofts and had their works recorded infrequently. It is unlikely that any of them pine for those days, although they might privately regret their change of status from avant-gardists to mainstream composers.</p>
        <p>Now Minimalism is a major-label concern, and although recordings of this repertory may not proliferate at the rate of, say, Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," competing versions are becoming plentiful. Two new releases include the second recordings of Terry Riley's "In C" and Philip Glass's "Company," and the</p>
        <p>third</p>
        <p>of John Adams's "Shaker Loops," Steve Reich's "Six Pianos" and "Eight Lines" (counting alternative scorings of those works) and Mr. Glass's "Facades."</p>
        <p>Equally striking, both releases come from enthusiastic, capable British ensembles, a sign that Minimalism has finally made inroads in western Europe. Until now, the style's greatest European adherents have been from the east, including the Hungarian Group 180 ensemble and the Estonian composer Arvo Part.</p>
        <p>The London Chamber Orchestra offers "Minimalism" (Virgin VC 7 91168; CD and cassette) as the eighth and most inviting installment in a series that strives to chart the history of the symphonic repertory. The group brings a distinct point of view to this music, and notable virtuosity. Although I remain fond of the original chamber scoring of "Shaker Loops," the Ridge Quartet's account (New Albion NA014) cannot touch the new one for pointed accenting, drama and sheer electricity; nor can the San Francisco Symphony recording of the orchestral version (Philips 412 214).</p>
        <p>The English orchestra's brisk reading of Mr. Reich's "Eight Lines" is similarly driven and edgy. The Glass pieces, which come from the gentler side of the composer's catalogue, are played with exceptional warmth and refinement. Christopher Warren-Green, the ensemble's director, is not shy about shaping lines, rebalancing textures and toying with dynamics, and the results give the music an almost Romantic musicality one might not otherwise have suspected. The third movement of "Company," in Mr. Warren-Green's hands, could almost be Grieg.</p>
        <p>To close its program, the orchestra commissioned "The Frontier" from Dave Heath, an English composer born in 1956. Except for a recurring, repetitive rhythmic figure that functions almost as a ritornello, this lush, energetic score strikes me as neo-Romantic rather than Minimalist. But these days Mr. Glass's, Mr. Reich's and Mr. Adams's music often sounds that way too.</p>
        <p>Piano Circus, a keyboard sextet, made a strong impression with Mr. Reich's "Six Pianos" at Alice Tully Hall last summer, and now offers a vibrant reading of the work as half its debut recording (Argo 430 380; CD and cassette). "Six Pianos" is one of Mr. Reich's phase pieces, in which a process of rhythmic displacement drives apart the lines that make up the opening figure. In this ensemble's hands, the work is magical. Illusions of melodies emerge and disappear, and textures change gradually from fully pianistic to organlike to something approaching the crispness of a harpsichord.</p>
        <p>The rest of the recording is devoted to Mr. Riley's "In C," whose title is usually preceded by the word seminal, and for good reason. The composer's own 1968 recording (CBS/Sony MK 7178) is a classic; and on CD, with the old LP's false ending at the side break removed, it has the additional virtue of continuity.</p>
        <p>The work is such that no two performances will be alike: it is merely a set of 53 figures to be played in order but ad libitum, with no constraints on instrumentation or duration. So one needn't worry much about authenticity in choosing between the available versions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley's recording, played by winds and pitched percussion, grows thick-textured and hypnotic over its 41-minute run. Piano Circus, using pianos, electric piano, harpsichords and vibraphone, gives an account that is half as long and in some ways more fascinating. Individual lines are distinct, tactile and delicately traced, and the 53 figures appear to have been arranged with an ear toward textural variety, interplay and a touch of humor.  RECORDINGS VIEW</p>
