        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Oestreich raises some disturbing issues concerning the future of classical music radio. I was raised in the 40's and 50's with WQXR as a companion, and I well remember hearing many major compositions for the first time on such programs as "Breakfast Symphony," "Morning Concert," "Midday Symphony," etc.</p>
        <p>When advertisers discovered classical radio, it followed naturally that four short works would readily fit into the time occupied by one Tchaikovsky Fifth, thus allowing for the insertion of additional commercial announcements. Many public radio stations, not hampered by this particular problem, have followed the trend anyway, for reasons still curious to me.</p>
        <p>Classical broadcasters who assume that every automobile must be serviced with at least one complete selection per ride to the station, supermarket or office have already lost that particular audience segment. Those listeners have replaced their radios with cassettes made at home or their programmable, portable CD players -- a perfect 16.5 minutes to Metro North. Travelers who listen to classical music radio want only one thing: music to accompany them. If they miss the last movement, they'll play it at home that night or call the station to find out what the composition is if it's new to them.</p>
        <p>Broadcasters are a conservative lot. This may be the result of years under the watchful eyes of the F.C.C. The rule that guides them seems to be: "Don't offend anyone."</p>
        <p>This has led to one of the main reasons why the classical music airwaves have become choked with endless hours of mostly inferior music from the Italian Baroque -- that this music is, for the most part, so wholly forgettable that no one can be seriously offended by it: Valium for the auditory nerves. God forbid that listeners should be challenged by Bruckner while navigating the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>Classical programmers who delete movements from concerti as being too boring or slow to suit their listeners show a total lack of knowledge of the art form that pays their salaries as well as a complete disrespect for their audience. And those who denigrate waltzes have obviously never watched the telephones ring during a pledge break after one has cheered up would-be contributors.</p>
        <p>At WWFM in Trenton, where I work as an on-call announcer, Bruckner, Mahler, Shostakovich and Johann Strauss are alive, well and unabridged. GLENN A. SMITH Hightstown, N.J.</p>
