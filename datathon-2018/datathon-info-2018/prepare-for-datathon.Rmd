- We've been over R/RStudio and EDA many times in class, but please find
some extra resources just in case you find this helpful.

How to deal with large files in \texttt{R}
===

- Avoid the following commands: \texttt{read.table} and \texttt{read.csv}

- I find the most useful command is \texttt{fread}, which is in the \texttt{library(datatable)}

- For a tutorial on reading data, see some information from DataFest done by Colin Rundel and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel
